Last changes: 2023-04-17

This site is not sharing private data with anyone or any 3rd party application. The website/app (later on referred as "
app") is here to help people
share rides and lower their costs.
It is completely free and open-source. It can be found on GitHub.

## Registration

We require your email and name upon registration. Your name is visible to everyone. The email address is not visible and
we
use it only to send you notifications about ride requests. You can delete your account anytime and your data will be
deleted from our system.

## Driver profile

Driver's profile is not mandatory. If you decide to fill in the data we will ask you for your car name and licence
plate. The data is used only to provide higher security to the passengers. The car name and licence plate are not
publicly
available. Car name is available on your public profile (which can be accessed only if a person is logged in).
Car name and licence plate are visible only to the driver and passenger the driver accepted for a ride.

## User profile

Phone number can be added from settings. It is not required at the moment but it helps to raise security and trust among
drivers and passengers.
You can choose whether you want to display phone number publicly on your profile (profile is visible only to registered
users). Your phone number is visible to you and to people who have requested a ride from you.

## Responsibilities

We do not have a responsibility outside of this app and we are not responsible for any disputes between drivers and

system to show the reliability of people.
