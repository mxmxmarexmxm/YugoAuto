# Privacy Policy

This site is not sharing private data with anyone. The website/app (later on referred as "app") is here to help people
share rides and lower their costs.
It is completely free and open-source. It can be found on GitHub.

We require your email and name upon registration. The phone number is optional and you may add it to the profile. Phone
number is visible to registered users only. Your name is visible to everyone. The email address is not visible and we
use it only to send you notifications about ride requests.

We use a 'remember me' cookie to keep you logged in to our website even after you close your browser. By continuing to
use our website, you consent to the use of this cookie.

We do not have a responsibility outside of this app and we are not responsible for any disputes between drivers and
passengers outside of the app. The app is here to connect people for the purpose of ride-sharing. The app uses a rating
system to show the reliability of people. Members can rate each other.
