This site is not sharing private data with anyone or any 3rd party application. The website/app (later on referred as "
app") is here to help people
share rides and lower their costs.
It is completely free and open-source. It can be found on GitHub.

We require your email and name upon registration. Your name is visible to everyone. The email address is not visible and
we
use it only to send you notifications about ride requests. You can delete your account at any time and your data will be
deleted from our system.

We use a 'remember me' cookie to keep you logged in to our website even after you close your browser. By continuing to
use our website, you consent to the use of this cookie.

We do not have a responsibility outside of this app and we are not responsible for any disputes between drivers and
passengers outside of the app. The app is here to connect people for the purpose of ride-sharing. The app uses a rating
system to show the reliability of people.

For any concerns contact us [here](https://www.yugoauto.com/contact/contact).
