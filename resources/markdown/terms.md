# Terms of Service

This site is not sharing private data with anyone. The website/app (later on referred as "app") is here to help people
share rides and lower their costs.
It is completely free and open-source. It can be found on GitHub.

We require your email and name upon registration. The phone number is optional and you may add it to the profile. Phone
number is visible to registered users only. Your name is visible to everyone. The email address is not visible and we
use it only to send you notifications about ride requests.

We use Google Analytics to check basic information about app usage.

We do not have a responsibility outside of this app and we are not responsible for any disputes between drivers and
passengers outside of the app. The app is here to connect people for the purpose of ride-sharing. The app uses a rating
system to show the reliability of people. Members can rate each other.
